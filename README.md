# Black-box-ML-Models-Comparison
This project compares the interpretability of LIME and RISE black-box machine learning models on image data 

The purpose of this research is to perform an experimental study comparing the explainability and interpretability of two explanation methods for black-box machine learning (ML) models. We compare Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation of Black-box Models (RISE) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) methods and see how they fare in interpreting black-box model predictions.
